/**
 * A brake on password guessing.
 *
 * `/api/auth/login` is the first unauthenticated, unmetered, CPU-heavy endpoint in
 * the app: every attempt runs 100,000 rounds of PBKDF2. Without a brake that is both
 * a credential-stuffing target and a way to spend our CPU budget for free, so the
 * two are counted together.
 *
 * Deliberately modest. It counts failures in KV against the client IP *and* the
 * email being tried, so one attacker cannot lock out a real user by hammering their
 * address from elsewhere — the IP runs out of attempts first. KV is eventually
 * consistent, so a distributed attacker can squeeze extra tries through the window;
 * that is accepted. This raises the cost of guessing, it is not an authorisation
 * boundary, and it fails *open* when KV is unavailable rather than locking everyone
 * out of a working app.
